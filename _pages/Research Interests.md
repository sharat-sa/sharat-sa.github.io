Broadly, I study energy materials from a fundamentals perspective - unravelling how fundamental material characterisitics scale up to produce complex operational behaviour. I do this mostly via experimental techniques - where my speciality lies at analytical chemistry; however I also occasionaly delve into computation and simulation for assistance. Outside of purely academic curiosity, this is done to develop more efficient materials for the global transition towards sustainable energy - driven by an urgent need to mitigate climate change.
