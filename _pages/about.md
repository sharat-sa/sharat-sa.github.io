I am a graduate student working with electrochemistry (recently - batteries), and I also love design, art, literature and journalism. A lot of my work can be found online at [Manthan][https://manthanmagazine.wordpress.com], with which I was associated with till June 2025 (when I graduated from IISER-Mohali), and will soon be translating my skills in re-invigorating [Inventa][https://sites.google.com/view/inventa23/]. I am also exceptionally proud of setting up the [Student-Run-Mess][https://web.iisermohali.ac.in/web/students/webpages/srmc.html] at IISER-Mohali (my alma-mater). I also firmly believe in certain principles - free and open science and software, equity and social justice, engaging pedagogy and science aimed at the masses, and liberty and knowledge above all. Often, these principles clash with society, so you might also find me protests. Otherwise, I am either in lab, running, gardening, or reading. I also love fusion indie music, and recently - rock! This is the new website, currently under construction, so some things might be broken. Hoping to put some resources here in due time, cheers!
